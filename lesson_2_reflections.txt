WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY? WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO IT?

.git file is added to the directory. This is necessary so commmits can be
created and files tracked.


HOW IS THE STAGING AREA DIFFERENT FROM THE WORKING DIRECTORY AND THE REPOSITORY? WHAT VALUE DO YOU THINK IT OFFERS?

Working directory shows the current status of files, repository is what
contains the history of the files, while staging area is a snapshot of files
to be added to the repository.

HOW CAN YOU USE THE STAGING AREA TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ONE COMMIT PER
LOGICAL CHANGE?

By ensuring there is only one file in the staging area at any given time.

WHAT ARE SOME SITUATIONS WHEN BRANCHES WOULD BE HELPFUL IN KEEPING YOUR HISTORY ORGANISED? HOW WOULD BRANCHES HELP?

Branches would be useful when trying out experimental feature additions or
creating a different language version of an application. Bracnhes would
help because it keeps the experimental or divergent work separate from the
main work so if the feature doesn't work, you can easily go back to the main
branch.
